Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude
This project creates a visualization dashboard website using visualizations from the previous WeatherPy project.
In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means to navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. 

The website consists of 7 pages total, including:

A landing page with an explanation of the project, links to each visualizations page, and a sidebar containing preview images of each plot. Clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.

Four visualization pages, each with a descriptive title and heading tag.
The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison, and a paragraph describing the plot and its significance.

A "Comparisons" page that:
Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so one can easily visually compare them.
It uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.

A "Data" page that displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
